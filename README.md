## How to compile and run your program
Using the run function that comes with intelliJ, when the wanted shape is entered, the corresponding image will be displayed on the canvas.

## Any assumptions
---
## Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
Unlike the sample graphics, we did not set a layer to the same color. So even within a recursion, the color of each figure is different.

## Any known bugs or defects in the program

## Any outside sources (aside from course resources) consulted for ideas used in the project, in the format: o Idea1: We use a function that generates random colors, which references an external resource.
