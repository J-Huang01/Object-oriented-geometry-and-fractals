## CSCI 1933 
## Project1: Object-oriented geometry and fractals
## 2/10/2022

#### Classes we created:

 - Circle.java 
 - Rectangle.java 
 - Triangle.java 

#### Classes we edited:

 - FractalDrawer.java

#### Classes given (do not edit this file, but you should include with your submission):

 - Canvas.java

#### How to compile and run your program
 - Using the run function that comes with intelliJ, when the wanted shape is entered, the corresponding image will be displayed on the canvas.

#### Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
 - Unlike the sample graphics, we did not set a layer to the same color. So even within a recursion, the color of each figure is different.

#### Any outside sources (aside from course resources) consulted for ideas used in the project, in the format:
 - Idea1: We use a function that generates random colors, which references an external resource.
